**[FAQ](https://openmods.info/faq.html)**


What does it contain?
-----------
**In (mostly) chronological order:**

* A combination ladder and trapdoor, also known as the **Jaded Ladder**
* A creative-only **healer** block that slowly replenishes your health and food when you stand on it.
* A **guide block** to assist in various constructions
* Colorable **elevator blocks** to quickly travel between floors. Requires XP by default.
* **Light boxes** to display your maps on the wall, ceiling or floor
* Archery **targets** for a shooting range
* ~~**Torch arrows!**~~ *No longer implemented*
* **Player graves**, safekeeping for your last death (assuming you’re capable of regeneration)
* Colored **flags** for various purposes
* Liquid **tanks**-- portable, practical, and pliable any-size liquid containment
* Hang **gliders**!
* Random **trophies** that may or may not do odd things when right-clicked
* **Bear traps**-- like venus fly traps, but snappier
* **Luggage**, the traveling sentient chest
* **Sprinklers**, to accelerate the growth of crops and other growables // m1.5.2, v1.0.3
* **Item cannons** to shoot items around for transport
* **Vaccum hoppers**-- like regular hoppers, but not limited to the top and sucks up XP. Compatible with BuildCraft!
* **Sonic goggles**-- echolocation for Steves
* **Sponges** for getting rid of liquids fast and effectively
* The Redstone Configurable Pulse Lightweight Mega Touch Sensor, also known as the **BIG BUTTON**
* Blocks drawn by **pencils** and **crayons** that are only seen by the imaginative eye
* **Fans**-- the power of an industrial fan in the size of a desk fan
* A wearable **crane** for picking up blocks and entities
* **XP Bottler**-- should be self-explanatory
* **Magnet turtles**-- turtles don't have CRT screens, so we should be fine
* **Village highlighter**-- shows the village borders and where their golem guardians spawn
* The **Slimalizer**, which detects slime chunks
* **Paths**, an alternative to gravel roads // m1.6.x, v1.2.0
* The **Block Breaker** and **Block Placer** are back! A perfect replacement for the now-dormant RedPower mod
* **XP Drain**-- stand on one attached to a tank, and your XP will be drained and turned into a liquid state
* The **Auto Anvil** and **Auto Enchantment Table**, imported fresh from OpenXP. Uses liquid XP to perform their function automatically.
* The **Sleeping Bag**. Finally, a way to sleep on the go without resetting your spawn point!
* The **Rope Ladder**-- a magic ladder that doesn’t need support to hold itself up and adjusts its own size to match the ground. Single use.
* The **Donation Station**-- tells you which mod a block or item comes from, and lets you support the modder that created it
* A painting/staining system for blocks, including: // m1.6.x, v.1.2.2
  * A **Paint Mixer**-- makes paint using dyes and milk. Millions of colors possible. 
  * A paint **brush** to paint white **canvases** and other blocks.
  * **Stencils** that are made using the **Drawing Table** to paint specific areas of blocks
  * A **Squeegee** that liquefies paint to clean it off of blocks
* ~~Listen to music among other things with the **radio**!~~ *Killed!*
* Exciting graphics and much more to come.

Compiling
--------------
We will try keep the building instructions as up-to-date as possible, but things may change without notice.

### Windows
You will require [msysgit](http://code.google.com/p/msysgit/downloads/list) or git installed with cygwin. Alternatively I would suggest installing [GitHub for Windows](http://windows.github.com/) and checking out the repo with that.

#### Check out the repo
Use Github for Windows or use a command prompt/powershell with git binaries in the Environment path.
```git clone https://github.com/OpenMods/OpenBlocks.git```
#### Change directory
```cd OpenBlocks```
#### Fetch dependencies (OpenModsLib etc.)
```
git submodule init
git submodule update
```
#### Run gradle build
OpenBlocks uses Forge Gradle build system, as almost any other mod this days. There are few good tutorials, so we will include just basic command for building:

```
gradle.bat build
```

The resulting files should be in the `build/lib` folder. File ending with `-deobf` is unobfuscated version for development use.

### Linux or OSX
Much the same as Windows, open a terminal window where you wish to checkout the repo and type
```
git clone https://github.com/OpenMods/OpenBlocks.git
cd OpenBlocks
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

In **OSX**, git is typically supplied. Otherwise it can be installed through the apps thingy that OSX has (Obviously I know very little about OSX but you want the dev tools stuff).

**(To install git and other command line tools on OS X, tun `xcode-select --install` in the terminal (/Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app))**

The linux git can be fetched from any package manager. If you're on a Debian based machine (This includes **Ubuntu**) you likely have aptitude, so the command would be ```sudo apt-get install git```. 

If you're running a RedHat based system, such as **CentOS** or **Fedora** (or some other Distro I've never heard of), then you might have the yum package manager ```sudo yum install git-core```. In the case that this does not work through yum, you might not have the packages added to yum to be able to find git. I wont go in to these here, but if you have issues feel free to contact NeverCast in #OpenMods on irc.esper.net.
#### Then run gradle
